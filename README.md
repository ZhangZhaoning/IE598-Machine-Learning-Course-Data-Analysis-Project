# IE598_F18_HW3

This is a course project finished during my Master of Science in Financial Engineering Degree.

The project used the sonar dataset obtained from the UCI website. I firstly used the Pandas and Numpy to do the data wrangling and then used the seaborn and other visulization tool in python spider to explore the data and analyzed different attributes' relationship.
